This is the live repository for my current projects concerning generative modeling in science and society.  

These files are WORKS IN PROGRESS.

The primary reason for utilizing github for research and writing is to show raw evidence of human generated work.

Diffs are automatically computed and viewable via the commit history.

PDFs must be manually uploaded for now, but .tex files are committed via Overleaf.
